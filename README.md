# Churn Analysis With ML

Welcome to the `Churn-Analysis-With-ML` repository. This project is focused on analyzing the churn rate of a bank using various machine learning and classic analysis techniques.

## Project Description

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers leaving a business. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for business retention efforts. In this project, we analyze a bank's customer churn rate using a variety of techniques, including KMeans clustering, deep learning models, and traditional statistical analysis methods.

## Techniques Used

1. **KMeans Clustering**: KMeans is a type of unsupervised learning used when we have unlabeled data. By using KMeans, we can identify clusters of customers with similar behaviors which can provide insight into why customers are leaving.

2. **Deep Learning**: Deep learning models are capable of learning complex patterns using large amounts of data. By using a deep learning model with a sigmoid activation function, we can predict the probability of a customer churning.

3. **Classic Analysis Techniques**: Traditional statistical methods are used to understand the data and the relationships between different features. These techniques include data visualization, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries such as scikit-learn, keras, pandas, and matplotlib.
